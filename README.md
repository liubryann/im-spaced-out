# Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge Winter 2021

### Features implemented:
- basic technical requirements 
- made it look better by 0.1
- saves likes of users based on cache 
- added a loading state 
- created shareable links 
- added date picker (selected date also cached)

Note: I did not forget the heart but polaris card is not too customizable by design so I decided not to do it
